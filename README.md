# Advanced RC Indicator: FVG Detection with AI/ML Enhancement

## ⚠️ Educational & Testing Stage ⚠️
**IMPORTANT**: This indicator is currently in the testing and educational stage. It is provided for learning purposes and experimental use only. Performance may vary, and the indicator is still being refined. Users should thoroughly backtest and forward test before using in live trading environments. Consider this a beta version intended for educational purposes.

## Overview
The Advanced RC Indicator is a sophisticated Fair Value Gap (FVG) detection system with integrated artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. It identifies significant market imbalances where price moves so quickly that it creates "gaps" that often get filled later. The AI/ML components analyze these patterns to predict which FVGs have the highest probability of trading success.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains two versions of the indicator:

1. **Basic Version**: Fair Value Gap detector with fundamental machine learning prediction
2. **Advanced Version**: Enhanced with ensemble ML models, market regime detection, anomaly detection, and adaptive parameters

Both versions are optimized for gold trading on 5-minute charts but can be adapted for other instruments with appropriate parameter adjustments.

## What are Fair Value Gaps?
Fair Value Gaps represent price inefficiencies where the market moves too rapidly, creating imbalances that often get "filled" as price returns to establish fair value. There are two types:
- **BISI** (Buyside Imbalance/Sellside Inefficiency): Bullish gaps where price moves up quickly 
- **SIBI** (Sellside Imbalance/Buyside Inefficiency): Bearish gaps where price moves down quickly

## Installation
1. In TradingView, open the Pine Editor
2. Paste the script code for your chosen version (basic or advanced)
3. Save the script and add it to your chart

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started
The indicator works immediately upon adding to your chart:

1. Add the indicator to your chart (optimized for XAUUSD 5-minute timeframe)
2. Green boxes represent bullish FVGs (potential buy opportunities)
3. Red boxes represent bearish FVGs (potential sell opportunities)
4. BUY/SELL signals appear when entry conditions are met
5. Dashed lines show suggested stop loss and take profit levels
6. FVGs are color-coded by type (Perfect, Breakaway, Rejection)

### Machine Learning Process
The ML component enhances performance over time:

1. **Data Collection Phase**: The indicator tracks trade outcomes (winning vs. losing)
2. **Initial Training**: Once 500 samples are collected (configurable), initial training occurs
3. **Active Prediction**: After training, the ML system color-codes FVGs by probability:
   - Green: High probability (>70%)
   - Orange: Medium probability (40-70%)
   - Red: Low probability (<40%)
4. **Continuous Learning**: The model keeps improving from each new trade outcome

### Training Timeline
The time to reach 500 samples depends on:
- **Trading frequency**: More trades = faster training
- **Timeframe**: Lower timeframes collect data faster
- **Market volatility**: More FVGs form in volatile markets

Rough estimates:
- Active day trading (5-minute chart): ~1-2 weeks
- Swing trading (daily chart): ~2-3 months

## FVG Types
1. **Perfect FVG**: Standard gap formation, most reliable for entries
2. **Breakaway FVG**: Gap with strong momentum continuation, good for trend trading
3. **Rejection FVG**: Gap with potential reversal signals, useful for counter-trend opportunities

## Recommended Settings for Gold 5-Minute Charts

## Performance Considerations
The Advanced version includes multiple ML models and real-time analysis, which may impact chart performance on some systems. If you experience delays:

1. Reduce the Maximum FVG Age parameter
2. Disable unnecessary features (start with Anomaly Detection)
3. Use a simpler Feature Set (Basic instead of Full)
4. Reduce the number of models in the Ensemble
