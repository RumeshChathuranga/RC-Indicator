## ⚠️ Educational & Testing Stage ⚠️
**IMPORTANT**: This indicator is currently in the testing and educational stage. It is provided for learning purposes and experimental use only.

Consider this a beta version intended for educational purposes.

## Overview
This specialized Fair Value Gap (FVG) indicator is optimized for gold trading on 5-minute charts, detecting significant imbalances in market structure where price moves so quickly that it creates "gaps" that may be filled later.

## What are Fair Value Gaps?
Fair Value Gaps represent price inefficiencies where market moves too rapidly, creating imbalances that often get "filled" as price returns to establish fair value. There are two types:
- **BISI** (Buyside Imbalance/Sellside Inefficiency): Bullish gaps where price moves up quickly 
- **SIBI** (Sellside Imbalance/Buyside Inefficiency): Bearish gaps where price moves down quickly

## Key Features
- **Gold-optimized detection**: Uses absolute point measurement instead of percentages
- **Multiple FVG variants**: Detects Perfect, Breakaway, and Rejection FVGs
- **Multi-timeframe analysis**: Identifies FVGs across different timeframes
- **Integrated risk management**: Automatic SL/TP placement based on FVG structure
- **Entry signal system**: Clear BUY/SELL signals with customizable duration
- **Fully customizable visuals**: Adjust colors and transparency for all elements
- **5-minute timeframe optimization**: Parameter defaults calibrated for 5m gold charts

## Installation

2. Paste the entire script code
3. Save the script and add it to your chart

## Usage Guide
1. Add the indicator to a XAUUSD (Gold) chart, preferably on the 5-minute timeframe
2. Green boxes represent bullish FVGs (potential buy opportunities)
3. Red boxes represent bearish FVGs (potential sell opportunities)
4. BUY/SELL signals appear when entry conditions are met
5. Dashed lines show suggested stop loss and take profit levels

## FVG Types
1. **Perfect FVG**: Standard gap formation, most reliable for entries
2. **Breakaway FVG**: Gap with strong momentum continuation, good for trend trading
3. **Rejection FVG**: Gap with potential reversal signals, useful for counter-trend opportunities

## Risk Management
The indicator automatically calculates:
- **Stop Loss**: Placed below the FVG for buys, above the FVG for sells
- **Take Profit**: Based on your configured risk:reward ratio
- **R:R Labels**: Display the current risk:reward setup near entry points
